	<p>This is about us page...
	The primary purpose of an about us page is to inform the reader about the company and its operations. 
	This is a straightforward goal that nearly all businesses have to fulfill in some fashion or another. 
	However, there are other reasons why about us pages are common fixtures on business websites. 
	The text on these pages is a marketing tool for a business, enticing potential customers with both the history and 
	the aspirations of a business, as well as adding a human element. Additionally, about us pages are incorporated 
	into search-engine marketing efforts as a way to find potential customers through Web searches.
